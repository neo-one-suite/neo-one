## How Can I Contribute?

NEO•ONE is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into NEO•ONE itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. The [Help](/docs/getting-started#Help) section is the best place to start for getting support.

### Reporting Bugs

Well-written bug reports with consistently reproducible steps are invaluable to the development of NEO•ONE. Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Before creating an issue, please perform a [search](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) to see if the problem has already been reported. After you've determined a bug does not already exist, create an issue and fill in the template.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to NEO•ONE? Here are some great ways to get started:

- Chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/S86PqDE) about ways to contribute!
- Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement! All pages on this website include an edit button which you can click to modify the documentation.
- Adding test coverage is a great way to get familiar with the codebase.
- Find an existing issue with the [help wanted and good first issue](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted+label%3Agood%20first%20issue) labels.

Once you've had your first pull request approved and merged, find existing issues marked with [help wanted](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted) labels to continue contributing or suggest an enhancement. Respond on the issue thread expressing interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

## Pull Requests

- Fill in the pull request template.
- Pre-commit hooks will run basic checks automatically.
