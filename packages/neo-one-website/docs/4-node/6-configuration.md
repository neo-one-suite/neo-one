## Environment

```bash
{
  "environment": {

    "dataPath": string,

    "rpc": {
      "http?": {
        "port": number,
        "host": string
      },
      "https?": {
        "port": number,
        "host": string,
        "cert": string,
        "key": string
      }
    },

    "node": {
      "externalPort": number
    },

    "network": {
      "listenTCP": {
        "port": number,
        "host?": string
      }
    },

    "backup": {
      "tmpPath?": string,
      "readyPath?": string
    },

     "telemetry": {
      "port": number
    }
  }
}
```

### dataPath

*defaults to the data path supplied by [env-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-paths)*

`environment.dataPath` is the path used for storing blockchain data.

In the [local docker](/docs/node-docker#Examples) example we could store blockchain data in a location other than `/root/.local/share/neo_one_node`, it should be noted you will need to change the mount location as well.

### haltAndBackup

*defaults to **false***

`environment.haltAndBackup` enables a watcher which will halt the node when the rpc server's `readyHealthCheck` passes and begin a backup if a location is specified which you are authorized to push to.

::: warning

Note

To properly halt and backup, you must also provide `options.backup` and `options.rpc.readyHealthCheck` configurations. In the case of google-cloud you must also provide service credentials.

:::

### rpc

*by default only `http` is enabled on `localhost:8080` OR `localhost:$PORT` if you have set the environment variable $PORT*

`environment.rpc` is used to configure the rpc server's host options. You do not need to specify both `http` and `https` options.

### levelDownOptions

...

### node

*disabled by default*

`environment.node.externalPort` allows you to enable an external port to communicate with the node. (??? need to enable forward port from local docker ???)

### network

*disabled by default*

`environment.network.listenTCP` when provided *at least* a port this allows other nodes to create TCP connections with this one over that port. `host` is optional and defaults to `localhost`.

### backup

*defaults to ${environment.dataPath}/tmp and ${environment.dataPath}/ready respectively*

`environment.backup.tmpPath` specifies the location of downloaded backup files.

`environment.backup.readyPath` specifies the location of the `ready` file generated after successfully extracting the backup.

### telemetry

*disabled by default*

`environment.telemetry.port` specifies the port to use when serving node-metrics. When enabled, you can visit `localhost:<port>/metrics` to view metrics.

## Settings

```bash
{
  "settings": {
    "type": string,
    "privateNet": boolean,
    "address": string,
    "standbyValidators": string[]
  }
}
```

### type

*defaults to 'main'*

`settings.type` specifies which NEO network we are connecting to (???). Supported types are `main` and `test`.

### privateNet

*defaults to **false***

`settings.privateNet` specifies whether or not the node is connecting to a private network.

### address

*defaults to (???)*

`settings.address` (???)

### standbyValidators

(???)

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*by default none of these are defined*

Unlike other configuration options, settings in `options` are watched and applied immediately to the node without having to restart.

### node

`options.node` controls connection and consensus options for connecting with other nodes.

---

`rpcURLs` specifies a list of known node RPC URLs you would like to try and connect to. A list of public mainnet hosts can be found at http://monitor.cityofzion.io/.

`unhealthyPeerSeconds` sets how long (in seconds) to wait for a peer response before deeming it 'unhealthy'. Defaults to 300 seconds.

`conensus` (???)

### network

`options.network` can be used to control seeds, endpoints, and socketTimeout defaults.

---

`seeds` specifies external seeds you would like to connect to. (??? I know we talked about all these the other day but I'm still pretty unclear)

`peerSeeds` specifies trusted seeds, typically ones run by yourself or on the same cluster.

`externalEndpoints` specifies specific external endpoints you would like to connect to.

`maxConnectedPeers` sets the maximum number of peers the node will attempt to hold a connection with at once. Defaults to 10.

`connectPeersDelayMS` sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait after requesting a peer connection before requesting another. Defaults to 5000.

`socketTimeoutMS` sets the timeout of peer requests (in milliseconds). Defaults to 1 minute.

### rpc

`options.rpc` configures the internal RPC Server of the node. See `@neo-one/node-http-rpc`.

---

`server.keepAliveTimeout`: if you would like your server to close after *x* seconds without activity set a timeout here (in milliseconds).

`liveHealthCheck` *&* `readyHealthCheck` share the same configuration.
- `rpcURLs`: a list of RPC URLs to compare our node to
- `offset`: the acceptable difference of blocks ahead/behind to count as `live` or `ready`
- `timeoutMS`: timeout for RPC connections
- `checkEndpoints`: the number of different endpoints to check against before passing `true`/`false`.

`tooBusyCheck` (*experimental*): enable the tooBusy middleware which throttles requests to the node when under significant load. Currently an experimental feature, see [toobusy-js](https://github.com/strml/node-toobusy) for more. Set `tooBusyCheck.enabled` to **true** if you would like to try it.

`rateLimit` (*experimental*): enable the rateLimiter middleware which throttles requests to the node when too many have been made from the same address over a period of time. Currently an experimental feature, see [koa-ratelimit-lru](https://github.com/Dreamacro/koa-ratelimit-lru) for more. Set `rateLimit.enabled` to **true** to experiment with it.

### backup

`options.backup` handles the backup and restore configuration for the node.

---

`restore`: **true** to attempt and pull the latest backup from your provider on starting the node. **false** to ignore restoring and only backup.

`backup.cronschedule`: set a schedule for when to stop the node and backup. See `[cron format](http://www.nncron.ru/help/EN/working/cron-format.htm)

`options` is where you will specify either a `gcloud` or `mega` provider. NEO•ONE maintains a public google cloud repository of backups you may restore from using:

```bash
{
  "backup": {
    "options": {
      "gcloud": {
        "projectID": "neotracker-172901",
        "bucket": "bucket-1.neo-one.io",
        "prefix": "node_0",
        "maxSizeBytes": 419430400
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Where `maxSizeBytes` is the maximum size for a chunk of uploaded data.

## Monitor

```bash
{
  "monitor": {
    "level": string
  }
}
```

### Level

<!-- explain the levels !-->

## chainFile

(???) What actually are these? I mean I know we can make them and I fixed them recently, still not clear what they do

## dumpChainFile
