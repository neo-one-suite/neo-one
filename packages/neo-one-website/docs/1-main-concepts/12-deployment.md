title: Deployment

You've built your smart contract, tested it and built a dapp around it. Now it's time to deploy.

Productionizing your smart contract for deployment to a network other than your local network requires keeping a few things in mind which we will cover in this chapter.

## Deployment Specifics

### Properties

Smart contracts may specify an instance property called `properties` to specify some or all of the properties used during deployment:

```typescript
export class Contract extends SmartContract {
  public readonly properties = {
    codeVersion: '1.0',
    author: 'Alex DiCarlo',
    email: 'foo@bar.com',
    description: 'This Contract is the best one.',
  };
}
```

These properties have no impact on the execution of the contract, they're simply extra metadata that you may permanently attach to the contract on the blockchain.

### Upgrade

Every NEOâ€¢ONE smart contract automatically contains a public `upgrade` method. This method replaces the smart contract code as well as the static metadata associated with the contract while preserving the smart contract's storage. In other words, this method can be used to change the logic of your smart contract without losing the data.

In order to make it possible to upgrade your contract, you _must_ specify the `approveUpgrade` `public` method. This method should return a `boolean` indicating if the `upgrade` is approved:

```typescript
export class Contract extends SmartContract {
  public constructor(public readonly owner = Deploy.senderAddress) {}

  public approveUpgrade(): boolean {
    return Address.isCaller(this.owner);
  }
}
```

Using `Address.isCaller(this.owner)` is the most typical approach.

::: warning

Note

If you do not specify the `approveUpgrade` method, it is impossible for you or anyone else to `upgrade` the contract.

:::

### Destroy

All smart contracts have a `protected` method called `destroy` which any method may use to permanently delete the smart contract. Once `destroy` is called the smart contract can no longer be invoked and the storage is no longer accessible. You're not required to have a method that calls `destroy`, but if you do, it should probably look something like:

```typescript
export class Contract extends SmartContract {
  public constructor(public readonly owner = Deploy.senderAddress) {}

  public permanentlyDestroy(): boolean {
    if (!Address.isCaller(this.owner)) {
      return false;
    }

    this.destroy();

    return true;
  }
}
```

::: warning

Note

While the contract can no longer be invoked and the storage is not accessible, all of the past invocations still exist on the blockchain. The storage can still be accessed by replaying the blockchain from the beginning up until the point it was destroyed.

### Migration File

To deploy your contract to a network, you will need to define a `migration` file. The default location for this file is `neo-one/migration.ts`, but it can be [configured](/docs/config-options). A migration file simply exports a function to call the deploy method on your smart contracts with the appropriate arguments. It should look something like this:

```typescript
import BigNumber from 'bignumber.js';
import { MigrationContracts } from '../src/neo-one';

export default ({ token, ico, escrow }: MigrationContracts, _network: string) => {
  token.deploy();
  ico.deploy(undefined, new BigNumber(1566864121), undefined);
  escrow.deploy();
};
```

## Deploying to a Public Network

Good news! This feature is now available. With that said, we want to work closely with the first few users to deploy to the TestNet or MainNet to ensure a smooth, bug-free experience. Please reach out if you are ready and we will quickly work with you to deploy.
