## Main Net Ready!

NEO•ONE Smart Contracts are finally ready to hit NEO blockchain! Write, compile, test, and deploy your SmartContracts, all with one easy-to-use framework. NEO•ONE now has everything you need to take your Dapp from idea to production.

## What's New?

- Deploying and updating your SmartContracts on the blockchain is now simpler than ever. With that said, we want to work closely with the first few users to deploy to the TestNet or MainNet to ensure a smooth, bug-free experience. Please reach out if you are ready and we will quickly work with you to deploy.
- [DAPI Compliance](/docs/dapi-support) & [Remote Accounts](/docs/dapi-support) to connect directly to trusted wallets and DAPI providers.
- Tools for working with NEO•ONE in [React](/docs/react), [Angular](/docs/angular), & [Vue](docs/vue).

## Moving Towards 3.0

As NEO moves towards the much anticipated launch of NEO 3.0, NEO•ONE will continue to provide a first class blockchain development experience. We plan to walk in step with the NEO team to make sure that NEO•ONE and your Smart Contracts are ready to go with NEO 3.0.
