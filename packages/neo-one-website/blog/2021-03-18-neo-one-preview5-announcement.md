## NEO•ONE Preview5 Node

We are excited to announce our latest release of NEO•ONE. For this release we have targeted Preview5, the latest stable release of the [N3](https://medium.com/neo-smart-economy/introducing-neo-n3-the-next-evolution-of-the-neo-blockchain-b2960c4def6e) protocol currently under development. This release focuses on our node implementation as we are still working on getting our client and compiler packages up-to-date with the latest N3 releases.

There is currently a NEO•ONE Preview5 node deployed at https://staging.neotracker.io/rpc.

To build and run the node from source follow the documentation [here](/docs/node-source).

To get started with NEO•ONE you can install our node executable package from NPM with `yarn add @neo-one/node-bin@alpha` or `yarn add @neo-one/node-bin@3.1.1-preview5`. To run it run `npx neo-one-node --config <path/to/config.json>` where `<path/to/config>` is the full path to a valid node config file. For more information on node configuration see [here](/docs/node-configuration).

### Further Work

There is still a lot of work to do to get NEO•ONE ready for N3. We are now working on getting our node, client, and compiler packages up-to-date with the latest N3 TestNet release.

## Future

Look out for the upcoming releases that will include node, client, and compiler compatibility with N3 TestNet.
